                The Band has been together the best part of a decade, almost nine years, Little Richard has been Little Richard for about double that, but really, who else<br />
                could he be? It's something else to found a group that lasts. It's not a matter of "I-Was-There-When," though that's part of it; with so many bands falling<br />
                apart or kicking out members or just calling it quits, The Band has stuck together. A few years back, what was it like- playing favorite riffs, the old and<br />
                the new, picking up a new idea here and there, maybe writing a few songs, playing great and nobody caring,sometimes playing shitty no doubt and the nightclub<br />
                drunks heckling and walking out, spilling drinks on the stage if there was one- that was The Band I the early sixties, when they were called the Hawks. They<br />
                all came from Canada, with the exception of lead singer, drummer, and part-time mandolin exciter Levon Helm, who hailed from Arkansas- but some sort of<br />
                Southern country tradition, a feeling for a frontier that had moved on out West but was still really right there at home gave The Band its spirit and its tone.<br/>
